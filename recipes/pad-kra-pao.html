    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground chicken (or thinly sliced chicken breast/thigh)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5-6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3-5 Thai bird's eye chilies, minced (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh holy basil leaves (Thai: Krapow)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>3 cups cooked jasmine rice</li>
        <li>2 large eggs (optional, for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, and sugar until well combined; set aside.</li>
        <li>
            Sauté Aromatics: Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. 
            Add the minced garlic and chilies, and stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant (be careful not to burn the garlic).
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the Chicken: Add the chicken to the wok. 
            Stir-fry, breaking up any large chunks with a spatula, until the chicken is mostly cooked through and starting to brown.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season: Pour the prepared sauce mixture over the chicken. Continue to stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes until the sauce coats the meat and the chicken is fully cooked.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add Basil: Turn off the heat and immediately toss in the fresh holy basil leaves. Stir quickly for a few seconds until the leaves are just wilted from the residual heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble: Divide the cooked jasmine rice into bowls. Top with a generous portion of the basil chicken. If desired, fry an egg in a separate pan until the edges are crispy and the yolk is still runny, and place it on top of each bowl.
        </li>
    </ol>
