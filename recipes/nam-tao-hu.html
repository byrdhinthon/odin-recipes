    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dried whole yellow soybeans</li>
        <li>6-7 cups water (adjust for desired creaminess)</li>
        <li>3-4 fresh pandan leaves, tied into a knot</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar (white or brown, adjust to sweetness preference)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Optional: Toppings such as basil seeds, barley, gingko nuts, or cubes of grass jelly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Soak the Beans: Rinse the soybeans thoroughly. Place them in a large bowl and cover with plenty of water. 
            Let them soak overnight (or for at least 6-8 hours) until the beans have expanded and are soft enough to split with your fingernail. 
            Drain and rinse again.
        </li>
        <li>
            Blend and Extract: In a blender, combine the soaked soybeans with about 3 cups of the water. 
            Blend on high until you have a smooth, frothy puree. Pour the mixture into a nut milk bag or a cheesecloth-lined strainer over a large pot. 
            Squeeze the cloth firmly to extract as much milk as possible. 
            (Repeat this process with the remaining water and the leftover pulp if necessary to get all the flavor out).
        </li>
        <li>
            Simmer with Aromatics: Place the pot of raw soy milk on the stove over medium heat. 
            Add the knotted pandan leaves and the salt. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, stirring constantly to prevent the bottom from scorching.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook Thoroughly: Once it starts to boil, reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer gently for 15-20 minutes. 
            This step is crucial to remove the raw "grassy" bean taste. Continue to stir frequently and skim off any foam or skin that forms on top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sweeten and Serve: Remove the pandan leaves. Stir in the sugar until dissolved (or leave it unsweetened and add syrup later). 
            Serve hot in bowls or mugs. If you like, add your choice of toppings like basil seeds or barley for the full street-food experience.
        </li>
